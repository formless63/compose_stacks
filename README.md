# compose_stacks
Personal storage for docker compose stacks. If you use these, please check the original source for changes - my examples are current as of the most recent commit on that example.

If you are new to compose, you should brush up on the basics before diving in:

https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/

Do yourself a favor and install a GUI to manage your compose stacks as well. Most of these GUIs can even be used to reference this repo directly.
